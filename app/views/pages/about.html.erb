        <p class="about-me-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked in the service industry for several years before deciding that it was time to start on a new career path. My life long love of computers and learning lead me to join a bootcamp with Bottega Tech, which has been an incredible experience. The enivorment setup by the instructors is one condusive to massive learning potential. I have learned not only how to write in the language the school teaches (Ruby), but how to understand code as an overall purpose.</p>

        <p class="about-me-body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fairly new to web development, but I love taking on challenges. I love tackling the tough problems that make everything in life a bit more interesting. I am a very hard working individual that loves to push my limits and see where I can take myself.</p>
